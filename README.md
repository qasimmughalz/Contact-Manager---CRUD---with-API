# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

You can run this project by

1- Installing all the packages by " npm install" command
2- Running the development server as "npm start".

This will start the project on localhost:3000 be default.

Thanks
